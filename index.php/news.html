Wander around and you’ll notice a host of ancient manmade structures, including megalithic stone tombs from the third century, Celtic fortifications and two castles (Castro Laboreiro from the tenth century and Castelo do Lindoso from the 12th century)".</p>

<p>The Organs of the Basilica of the Palace of Mafra have been awarded with the 2012 European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage/Europa Nostra Awards for its outstanding work in the field of conservation. Supported by the European Commission, these awards highlight every year excellence in conservation, research, education, training and awareness-raising. The jury was particularly impressed by "the restoration of this unique ensemble of majestic organs" and "the provision of an example for future generations of the perfect integration of moveable items into immovable architecture". The six organs are unique, not only because of their number - a remarkable feature in itself -, but because they were built simultaneously and originally conceived to play together. The restoration project aimed to give back to the public one of the most important 19th century sets, unheard for about 200 years. Absolutely Portugal invites you to rediscover the rich tradition of Portuguese organ music of the Baroque and Post-Baroque eras in Mafra!</p>

<p>When celebrating European Day of Parks (24 May), it's really worth thinking about the urgent need to protect our natural and cultural heritage. And did you know that Portugal has 13 National Parks? Their diversity is tremendous - form the beautifully hilly north-eastern Montesinho National Park to the world-famous Douro Internacional (home of the precious Port wine) or the magnificent Arrabida National Park by the sea, you'll explore breathtaking landscapes, find unique species of animals and rare flora and experience the local culture. It's the call of the wild, the freshness and the beauty of nature. At Absolutely Portugal we're committed to support sustainability and each tailor-made itinerary has this principle in mind - h<a href="ttp://www.absolutelyportugal.com/index.php/call-of-the-wild.html">ttp://www.absolutelyportugal.com/index.php/call-of-the-wild.html</a>.</p>

<p>The Portuguese architect Eduardo Souto de Moura has been awarded the 2011 Pritzker Prize, architecture's most prestigious honour! Having worked on his earlier years at Alvaro Siza Vieira' office, another Pritzker Laureate (1992), Souto de Moura has completed over sixty buildings, most of them in Portugal, and also in Spain, Italy, Germany, UK and Switzerland. Along his works are iconic projects such as the impressive Braga Stadium (2004) and the recent Paula Rego Museum Casa das Historias (2008) in Cascais. The Pritzker jury praised his "body of work that is of our time but also carries echoes of architectural traditions. His buildings have a unique ability to convey seemingly conflicting characteristics - power and modesty, bravado and subtlety, bold public authority and a sense of intimacy - at the same time".</p>
